        <h2>Transition</h2>
        <p> I have recently enrolled in Treehouses' Tech Degree program to become a Front End Webdeveloper. Once I am seperated, my goal is to acquire a job as a beginning Web Developer. Web Development is a complete new world for me! I am remaining optomistic and keeping a positive outlook as I embrace this new challege of learning these new skills. My first goal is to graduate from the Tech Degree Program by the end of this year. </p>

        <h2>Ultimate Goal</h2>
        <p>I think we have all dreamed of living the "American Dream" at some point in our lives. I mean, who wouldn't want to work for themselves? The ultimate goal is to become a seasoned Web Developer with the skills needed to build/produce any deseired product a client needs/wants. In reaching this goal, I believe I will be able to obtain all of the dreams I have for myself and my family. I want financial security for my family, I want to work from home and create my own work schedule, I want to retire at a young age, and most importantly I want control over my life. I've loved serving my country, but it's taguht me the valuable lesson that fmaily is the most important thing in life. I don't want to miss out on anymore moments or memories and I want to be present in my kids lives. This is my "American Dream" and it's something I've always dreamed of having. I see that in becoming a seasoned Web Developer, it will equip me with tools I need to build the Dream I have for me and my family.</p>
