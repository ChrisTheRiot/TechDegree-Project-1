        <h2>Transition</h2>
        <p> I have recently enrolled in Treehouses' Tech Degree program to become a Front End Webdeveloper. Once I am seperated, my goal is to acquire a job as a beginning Web Developer. Web Development is a complete new world for me! I am remaining optomistic and keeping a positive outlook as I embrace this new challege of learning these new skills. My first goal is to graduate from the Tech Degree Program by the end of this year. In addtion to acquiring my Tech Degree, I am also looking to become knowledgeable in each of the following languages: </p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ultimate Goal</h2>
        <p>I think we have all dreamed of living the "American Dream" at some point in our lives. I mean, who wouldn't want to work for themselves? The ultimate goal is to become a seasoned Web Developer with the skills needed to build/produce any deseired product a client needs/wants. In reaching this goal, I believe I will be able to obtain all of the dreams I have for myself and my family. I want financial security for my family, I want to work from home and create my own work schedule, I want to retire at a young age, and most importantly I want control over my life. I've loved serving my country, but it's taguht me the valuable lesson that fmaily is the most important thing in life. I don't want to miss out on anymore moments or memories and I want to be present in my kids lives. This is my "American Dream" and it's something I've always dreamed of having. I see that in becoming a seasoned Web Developer, it will equip me with tools I need to build the Dream I have for me and my family.</p>
