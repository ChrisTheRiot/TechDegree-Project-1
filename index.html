        <p>Hi, my name is Christopher Theriot and this is a little information about myself. I am 26 years old, married, and I have two little boys and excitingly have our third one the way! At the moment, I am in the process of transitioning back into the civilian world due to being Active Duty in the Air Force for the past 6 years.</p>
        <h3 id="my-experience">Job Experience</h3>
        <p>Experience wise, I have worked quite a few jobs and have gained a lot of experience from each. Since graduating high school, I have worked in a wide variety of different jobs. Being from Louisiana, my first jobs were in relation to the Oil Field Industry; to include warehouse worker, truck driver, and sales-rep. I then moved on to becoming a Manager at a connivence store and then finally joined the military. I am currently a Staff Sergeant in Air Force as a Material Manager; better know as Logistician. I have worked numerous jobs within my career field during my time in the Air Force and I have gained a lot of knowledge and experiences that I look forward to applying to my new career path as a Web Developer.</p>

        <h2 class="my-transition">Transition</h2>
        <p> I have recently enrolled in Treehouses' Tech Degree program to become a Front End Web-developer. Once I am separated, my goal is to acquire a job as a beginning Web Developer. Web Development is a complete new world for me! I am remaining optimistic and keeping a positive outlook as I embrace this new challenge of learning these new skills. My first goal is to graduate from the Tech Degree Program by the end of this year. </p>

        <h2 class="my-goal">Ultimate Goal</h2>
        <p>I think we have all dreamed of living the "American Dream" at some point in our lives. I mean, who wouldn't want to work for themselves? The ultimate goal is to become a seasoned Web Developer with the skills needed to build/produce any desired product a client needs/wants. In reaching this goal, I believe I will be able to obtain all of the dreams I have for myself and my family. I want financial security for my family, I want to work from home and create my own work schedule, I want to retire at a young age, and most importantly I want control over my life. I've loved serving my country, but it's taught me the valuable lesson that family is the most important thing in life. I don't want to miss out on anymore moments or memories and I want to be present in my kids lives. This is my "American Dream" and it's something I've always dreamed of having. I see that in becoming a seasoned Web Developer, it will equip me with tools I need to build the Dream I have for me and my family.</p>
